WordPress login (WordPress Single Sign-On) using JWT token obtained from other WordPress sites or applications. Synchronize user sessions between your WordPress and other connected applications [24/7 SUPPORT]

== Description ==

The **[WordPress Login and Register using JWT plugin](https://plugins.miniorange.com/wordpress-login-using-jwt-single-sign-on-sso)** allows you to **log in (Single Sign-On)** into your WordPress application using the **JWT token(JSON Web token)** obtained from any other WordPress site or other applications/platforms including mobile applications. This helps users perform **autologin to WordPress** and **synchronize user sessions** without the need to log in again.

**WORDPRESS SINGLE SIGN-ON / SSO ( LOGIN INTO WORDPRESS )**
**WordPress Single Sign-On SSO** also simply called **WordPress SSO** allows you to login into WordPress using the credentials of other platforms. So, the user will just use a single set of credentials to log in to multiple applications.

**WordPress Single Sign-On / SSO using JWT(JSON Web Token)**
**WordPress Single Sign-On (SSO) with JWT** allows you to log into the WordPress site using the user-based JWT token obtained externally when the user authenticates for the first time in any connected external application.
The JWT token authentication is the most popular way of authentication nowadays as it is a secure and lightweight protocol. The JWT token can be obtained either when a user logs into other platforms via **[OAuth](https://oauth.net/)/[OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/)** protocol or can be created explicitly using the user information and secure algorithms. 
With this plugin, you can easily use the user-based JWT token to log a user in rather than asking them to authenticate again.

*Let's take an example* - If you have a WordPress site and mobile app, now if you are logged into the mobile app, now if you try to access the WordPress site, then to access the particular content, the WordPress site will ask for login again and which is not feasible, so with the JWT SSO (JWT Single Sign-On), you can create the JWT token for the user who is already logged into the mobile app and then on accessing the WordPress site, you can pass that JWT token in the request, using which the same user can authenticate and autologin to the WordPress site and hence won't need to enter the credentials again.

It supports possibly all kinds of **JWT tokens (access-token/id-token)** obtained from **OAuth/OpenID Connect** providers like **AWS Cognito**, **Microsoft Azure AD**, **Azure B2C**, **Okta**, **Keycloak**, **ADFS**, **Google**, **Facebook**, **Apple**, **Discord** and popular applications like **Firebase**.

WordPress login using the JWT also called **JWT SSO (Single Sign-On)** can be done from other platforms and applications including mobile apps (android or IOS), an app built with other programming languages like **.NET**, **JAVA**, **PHP**, **JS** etc. 

== Major functionalities ==


**WordPress Login Endpoint to create user-based JWT token**
Plugin provides the following API endpoint, which can be used to authenticate WordPress users and returns a user-based JWT which can be used to create login sessions in WordPress and other external applications.
`
/wp-json/api/v1/mo-jwt
`  

**WordPress Login using JWT**
This feature provides a way to auto-login users in WordPress using JWT obtained in a very secure way either via passing JWT token in the URL as a parameter, in the request header or shared via secured cookies.

**WordPress user register API endpoint to create users in WordPress using API**
This feature provides the following API endpoint to create users in WordPress in an easy way and on successful user registration, you will receive a JWT token in the response which can be used further for user login and WordPress REST API authorization.
`
wp-json/api/v1/mo-jwt-register
` 

**Delete/Remove users from WordPress using the user-based JWT token (JSON Web Token)**
This feature provides an API endpoint using which you can pass the JWT token and can easily delete the user and revoke access.
`
wp-json/api/v1/mo-jwt-delete
`

== USE CASES == 

* **Login to External applications using WordPress credentials**
If you are looking to authenticate your WordPress users to log in to external applications, then our plugin provides a login API endpoint using which you can easily authenticate WordPress users and can log in the users to those applications.

* **Single Sign-On Users using the JWT token provided by OAuth/OpenID providers**
This WordPress login and register using the JWT plugin supports the WordPress Single Sign On (WordPress SSO) or WordPress login using the user-based JWT token (id-token/access-token) provided by the external OAuth/OpenID Connect providers (like Microsoft Azure AD, Azure B2C, AWS Cognito, Keycloak, Okta, ADFS, Google, Facebook, Apple, Discord and many more..) on login in some other sites/applications using their credentials.
So, the user just needs to log in once on any other sites/platforms and a JWT token will be provided by these providers for those users will then be used further with security to autologin in other platforms.

* **Automatic WordPress login and site access from mobile app web view | Synchronize WordPress session in the mobile app web view**
Suppose you have a mobile application and want to allow users to access their WordPress site content in the mobile app web view which requires a login so asking the users to enter the credentials again wonâ€™t be a good user experience. So, our JWT login plugin provides a solution to you in which the user session from the mobile app can be synchronized with the WordPress site and the user can seamlessly access the WordPress site using the user-based JWT token without the need for a WordPress login again.

* **Automatic session synchronization between WordPress and other applications built on React, Node, Next JS, Flutter, Angular, Java, PHP, and C# ....**
Suppose you have a WordPress site connected to any external application built on any framework, then if you want a feature that if a user is logged in to any one application, should be automatically logged in to another as well. This can be easily achieved using the secure JWT.

* **Session sharing between WordPress and other applications sharing the same subdomain (hosted on the same domain)**
Suppose you have a WordPress site and other applications hosted on the same subdomain, such that if the user logs in to any one application, then can be auto-logged into other connected applications on that domain using secure cookie-based JWT token sharing. 
an pass the new user details like username, email, name and password(optional), role etc. in the request body and on successful response, your user will get created and the corresponding user-based JWT will be received and the appropriate error response will be returned on the failure.

* **Sync user login sessions between multiple platforms (Session sharing)**
If you have a WordPress site and other applications sharing the same subdomain and you want the feature in which if a user logged into one site (WordPress or another) and on accessing the other site in the same browser, then that user should get logged in automatically (user session to be synchronized). So, this feature is possible to have with our plugin's JWT cookie-based session-sharing feature.
